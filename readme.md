# Laptime Simulation examples using MATLAB and CasADi

This repository contains Matlab code that is intended to serve as a starting point for race car laptime simulation projects.

## Prerequisites

 * MATLAB (tested with R2018b)
 * [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/) (tested with v3.5.1)


## Installation

 * if MATLAB is installed on your machine, you only have to unzip CasADi and add it to your MATLAB path

## Getting started

 * to run the QSS example, call GGS_demo.m 
 * to run the optimal control example, call OC_demo.m
